# Python - Selective Aggregation and Analysis Techniques in Python | Python Data Structure Manipulation and Algorithms

## Description 
- In a series of Python projects, I cultivated a robust skill set in data manipulation, algorithmic problem-solving, and software development best practices. Through tasks such as calculating the pairwise product and sum of elements in data structures, generating multiplication tables, and summarizing data by custom criteria, I demonstrated my ability to efficiently process and analyze data. My work emphasized algorithmic thinking with the use of nested loops, data structure manipulation including lists and tuples, and the creation of custom functions for enhanced code modularity. These projects not only reinforced my technical proficiency in Python but also showcased my aptitude for applying mathematical concepts and logical problem-solving to develop practical, real-world software solutions.

# Pairwise Product and Summation Walk-Through:

```python
cList = [9, 4, 7, 3, 8]
cTuple = [5, 4, 3, 5, 2]
productList = []
listLen = len(cList)
loopIndex = 0
while loopIndex < listLen:
    productOfPair = cList[loopIndex] * cTuple[loopIndex]
    productList.append(productOfPair)
    loopIndex += 1
total = 0 
loopIndex = 0 
while loopIndex < listLen:
    total += productList[loopIndex]
    loopIndex += 1
print(total)
```
