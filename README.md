# 🐍 Python - Selective Aggregation and Analysis Techniques in Python | Python Data Structure Manipulation and Algorithms

## Description 
- In a series of Python projects, I cultivated a robust skill set in data manipulation, algorithmic problem-solving, and software development best practices. Through tasks such as calculating the pairwise product and sum of elements in data structures, generating multiplication tables, and summarizing data by custom criteria, I demonstrated my ability to efficiently process and analyze data. My work emphasized algorithmic thinking with the use of nested loops, data structure manipulation including lists and tuples, and the creation of custom functions for enhanced code modularity. These projects not only reinforced my technical proficiency in Python but also showcased my aptitude for applying mathematical concepts and logical problem-solving to develop practical, real-world software solutions.

# 💻 Pairwise Product and Summation:

<b> Code Overview: </b>
- This code calculates the pairwise product of corresponding elements in two lists (`cList` and `cTuple`) and then computes the sum of these products. It utilizes loops to iterate through the lists, performs arithmetic operations, and aggregates the results.

```python
cList = [9, 4, 7, 3, 8]
cTuple = [5, 4, 3, 5, 2]
productList = []
listLen = len(cList)
loopIndex = 0
while loopIndex < listLen:
    productOfPair = cList[loopIndex] * cTuple[loopIndex]
    productList.append(productOfPair)
    loopIndex += 1
total = 0 
loopIndex = 0 
while loopIndex < listLen:
    total += productList[loopIndex]
    loopIndex += 1
print(total)
```

# 📊 Multiplication Table Generator:

<b> Code Overview: </b>
- This code generates a multiplication table as a list of lists (`mulTable`). It uses nested for loops to iterate over rows and columns, calculates products for each combination of row and column indices, and populates the table accordingly.

```python
def buildMultTable():
    mulTable = []
    for outerLoop in range(10):
        currentLine = []
        for innerLoop in range(10):
            product = outerLoop * innerLoop
            currentLine.append(product)
        mulTable.append(currentLine)
    return mulTable
mt = buildMultTable()
for row in mt:
    print(row)
```

# 🌱 Middle Elements Summation:

<b> Code Overview: </b>
- This code defines a function sumMiddle() to calculate the sum of middle elements in a list, excluding the first and last elements. It then applies this function to a predefined list (`myList`) and prints the original and modified lists.

```python
def sumMiddle(dataList):
    lengthOfList = len(dataList)
    sliceToSum = dataList[1:lengthOfList - 1]
    middleSum = sum(sliceToSum)
    dataList[1:lengthOfList - 1] = [middleSum]
def program():
    myList = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    print(myList)
    sumMiddle(myList)
    print(myList)
program()
```
